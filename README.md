This repo has the following algorithms that I found as part of my DSA prep. Feel free to use them for your DSA practice.

### Search algorithms
- Linear search - `O(n)`
- Binary search - `O(log n)` - *works only if array is sorted*
- BFS (pending)
- DFS (pending)

### Sorting algorithms
- Bubble sort - `O(n²)` - *swap intensive*
- Selection sort - `O(n²)` - *less swapping than Bubble sort and constant memory*
- Insertion sort - `O(n²)` - *best suited for almost sorted arrays with time complexity O(n)*
- Quick sort - `O(n.log n)` - *one of the fastest sorting algorithm, but has O(n²) as worst case time complexity*
- Merge sort - `O(n.log n)` - *same for all scenarios, but has space complexity of O(n)*
- Counting sort (pending)
- Heap sort (pending)
- Bucket sort (pending)
- Tim sort (pending)
- Radix sort (pending)

### Data structures implementation
- Linked List (pending)
- Doubly Linked List (pending)
- Stack (pending)
- Queue (pending)
- Binary Tree (pending)

### Math algos
- Prime number : sieve of eratosthenes (pending)
- No of perfect Squares (pending)
- Factorial
